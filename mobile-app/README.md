# CSE 310 - Team Project (Mobile App in Kotlin)
This is the mobile app, built with Kotlin

## Setting Up For Viewing
If you would like to interact with the mobile app you can do the following:
 - Clone the repository using your terminal, VSCode, etc.
 - Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (with the emulator) if you don't already have it.
 - Open Android Studio (if it is your first time, you may have to do some setup)
 - Go to `File > Open`
 - Navigate to the cloned repository and open the `mobile-app` folder
 - Android studio should then run though some setup and a gradle sync
 - Once Android Studio finishes setting it up, you should be able to press the green play button on the top bar (alternatively, you can go to `Run > Run 'app'`)
    - If you don't have an emulator, you'll need to set that up ([Set up Android Studio emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd))
    - If you would like, you can also use an Android phone:
        - Just turn on [Developer Options](https://www.howtogeek.com/129728/how-to-access-the-developer-options-menu-and-enable-usb-debugging-on-android-4.2/) and enable USB debugging, Android Studio should automatically find it.
        - If not, select the dropdown next to the green play button, and choose `Troubleshoot Device Connections` and follow the steps
